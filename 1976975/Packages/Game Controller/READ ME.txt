Package Instructions
---------------------
1. The Game Controller script must be placed on an empty gameObject. Usable for a round based game

2. The UI elements need to be filled with your own UI objects.

3. To integrate this script into your own project the InitialiseRound function needs to call a SpawnFunction that can spawn enemies.
   This can be coded into the same script but I recommend a separate script

2. The number of rounds, round legnth, break length etc can be customised
