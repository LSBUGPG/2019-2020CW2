Package Instructions
----------------------
1. The AI Controller needs to be placed on an empty GameObject.

2. The UpdateSpawnPool in the controller needs a reference to the current round of the game so it can add enemy types into the spawn pool at the correct rounds.
   This can be handled externally by a Game Controller or internally by this script but I recommend a seperate script.

3. You can make as many enemy types as you want. You give them a name, HP amount, round to spawn and the prefab to use and the Controller 
   will add them into the spawn pool at the correct round

4. The enemy health script can be applied to any enemy type and will grab the HP value set in the controller automatically.

5. The melee enemy script can be placed on whatever enemy needs a melee behaviour. You must set the player transform so the enemy knows who to attack.
   The enemy requires a navMeshAgent as well as having a navmesh baked for the map. Without a navmesh the enemies won't be able to move.
