Package Instructions
---------------------
1. The Ability Controller and abilities script must be placed on the Player. The total mana, the MP5(mana regenerated per 5 seconds) and 
   the abilities themselves can be customised. The text objects must be filled so the current ability and mana can be displayed.

2. The player can enter the ability info in a data class list that stores the name, description and mana cost. There is a separate
   script called Abilities that is blank and this script is where you code your ability functions. These can be anything and will 
   be called in the switch statement. Just add a new switch for every ability.

3. The abilities must be entered in the same order in the switch statement as they are in the editor. For example, if a teleport ability
   was in switch 0 then it must also be the first entry into the ability list. This is so the indexes match up and mana cost can be referenced correctly
