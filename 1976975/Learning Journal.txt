I have learnt a lot of new and more efficient methods of coding while doing this project. For example, I'm very happy
with how I've learnt to use functions more effectively and breaking it down into much more modular, easily referencable 
parts. I have also learnt how to split up Classes better and modularise my code even more so it can be reused at later dates
normally I used to code everything under one class as long as they were similar functions but this often led to hard to read and follow code.
Both of these combined have improved the overall structure, readability and reusability of my code.

Another thing I learnt was how to use switch statements which are great for systems where you can have different outputs based on the ID provided.
This makes it easy to program in an ability system as all you need to do is increase or decrease an id value and it will pick the corresponding switch.

I also learned how to use data classes more effectively in this project too. How to set them up and then set up a custom list using those data types.
This worked really well in my AI controller as I was able to have a container for each enemy type that included the prefab you want to use, the round to spawn and their start HP.
