[ PlayerLook ]
This script should be attached to your ‘PlayerCamera’ which enables you to look around with the mouse, making use of an invisible cursor and clamping. 
For the Player object, you will need an empty game object with a character controller component, and a camera. This camera will be your player camera. The camera is to be placed at the top of the game object. If your player game objects Y position is 0, you can set your camera Y position to 0.9. This will put the camera at the top of your player game object but prevent clipping when jumping into ceilings, for example.

[ PlayerMove ]
This script should be attached to the ‘PlayerBody’, which in the example given is the previously empty game object. This script applies an emphasis on the Z axis so that when using the input system to move, Z will always be forward.
