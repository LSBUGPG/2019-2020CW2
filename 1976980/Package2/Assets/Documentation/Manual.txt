FORMATION USER GUIDE PACKAGE 2; CHARACTER DAMAGE AND HEALTH SYSTEM

This document explains the behaviours contained in this package and describes how to use them to make 
a system as used in a 2D platformer game. 

BEHAVIOURS 

- Camera tracking 
- Jumping 
- Damage Player 
- Health bar

CAMERA TRACKING 

can be found in the script setup CameraFollow. it works by creating a public transform titled "Target" so you can
add the player to the script directly in the float and reference it in the script, which tracks player movement. 
You can also adjust the offset and smooth speed in the float to get a smoother image of the player as the camera 
tracks it. This is all set up in the script using Vector3 which uses target.poisition to find the player and then
adjusts according to player speed and movement.

JUMPING 

Can be references in the script PlayerControl. This script uses raycasts to find out whether the player is
interacting with the floor and then determines the jump height and velocity through an adjustable public float. 
It determines what the ground is through a SerializeField refering to anything titled by the layer platforms, and
anything not labelled platforms means that the player won't have the ability to jump. You can also adjust the weight
of the players jump by using the player's RigidBody to increase the gravity, which will make for a smaller heavier
jump the higher the gravity. 

DAMAGE PLAYER 

Damage inflicted onto the player is created through the script PlayerHealth. It works by using onCollisionStay2D
which uses colliders to determine whether the game object the player is interacting with will inflict damage onto
it. If the player interacts with any object with the tag "Enemy", the player will take one damage, which then 
interacts with the health bar to show the players health being inflicted. 

HEALTH BAR 

There are two script set ups for the health bar system found in the scripts HealthBar and HealthSystem. The health
bar set up works by interacting with the UI object slider which determines the slider value is of equal value to 
the current health. The slider UI script itself uses the fill image in the UI as a way to show health increasing
and decreasing. The HealthSystem script works by creating the public float for the slider to adjust the slider 
health.
