FORMATION USER GUIDE PACKAGE 4; COLLECTABLES AND GAME COMPLETE

This document explains the behaviours contained in this package and describes how to use them to make 
a system as used in a 2D platformer game. 

BEHAVIOURS 

- Health pickup 
- Coin pickup and score
- "Game Complete" screen when player interacts with the flag 

HEALTH PICKUP

The code for this can be found within the script called HealthCollect. This works by using collider2D scripts 
with the command OnCollisionEnter2D, which if it discovers anything with the tag "Player", it adds health by
deducting the damage before it is then destroyed by the command Destroy(game.Object);

COIN PICKUP AND SCORE

The code for this can be found inside the script CoinCollect. It works in a simular way to the health pick-up, 
where it uses OnCollisionEnter2D plus the players tag "Player" where it'll be destroyed. This then interacts with
the UI text TotalCoins by finding the object and then using GetComponent<Text>(); so it can change the score. It 
does this by using the split between the text and the semi colon and adds a numerical value to the score on the
other side of the semi colon and calculates the current total.

GAME COMPLETE WITH FLAG INTERACTION 

Code can be found in the script Complete. This uses the flag game object found in the menu and much like the other 
scripts, uses the OnCollisionEnter2D to complete the task. using the collision between the game object and the 
player colliding with it (tagged as "Player") the code will find the game complete text in the UI and present it
on screen after the player collides with the object.
