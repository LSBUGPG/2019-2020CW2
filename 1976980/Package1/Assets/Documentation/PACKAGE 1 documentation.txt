FORMATION USER GUIDE PACKAGE 1; CHARACTER MOVEMENT AND INTERACTION

This document explains the behaviours contained in this package and describes how to use them to make 
a system as used in a 2D platformer game. 

BEHAVIOURS 

- Character Movement
- Dialogue Trigger 
- Dialogue Manager 
- NPC controller 

CHARACTER MOVEMENT 

Can be found in the script CharacterMove. It uses the RigidBody2D on the player to move the character around (Rigid
Bodys are physics based which makes them ideal for movement). It calls upon this in the script and uses horizontal 
movement to move the player, and does this by multiplying movement by speed to move the player.

DIALOGUE TRIGGER 

can be found within the script DialogueTrigger. This works by calling upon the public script Dialogue, and then finds the 
script DialogueManager to start the dialogue its already called upon. 

DIALOGUE MANAGER 

Found in the script DialogueManager. This stores a large part of the scene including the animations for the pop up 
UI dialogue. It works by queuing a string of sentences found in the Dialogue script and calling upon the next 
sentence when it finishes displaying each sentence. The animation is triggered at the start and the end of the 
script by pressing the button, and once the dialogue is complete from the script, the script commenses void 
EndDialogue by setting the animation bool "IsOpen" to false. 

NPC CONTROLLER 

This code can be found in the script ProfessorControl. The purpose of this script is so the player can interact 
with the NPC, which in doing so is what trigger the public list string of dialogue sentences, which are updated
through the means of the other scripts. 

HOW TO PLAY 

- Press a & d or arrow keys left and right to move
- Point and click "Lets Chat" button to talk to the NPC
- Press skip to continue through the dialogue until the dialogue ends
