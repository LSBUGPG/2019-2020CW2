FORMATION USER GUIDE PACKAGE 3

this document explains behaviours in this package and how to use them to play the level set up for this package that 
demonstrates how to do enemy damage and movement 

BEHAVIOURS;

- Enemy movement 
- Enemy health 
- Death Respawn 

ENEMY MOVEMENT

listed in the script labeled "Patrol". This script uses a RayCastHit2D that casts rays onto the ground beneath it
to recognise how far its travelled. If it detects no more ground space it then turns the AI around to pace back the
other direction. 

ENEMY HEALTH 

Uses three scripts to destroy enemy health; Enemy, Weapon and Bullet. The weapon is a shooting script attached to
the player that instigates the shooting of the bullet prefab. The bullet prefab has its own script that recognises
Enemy through collision trigger and anything with the tag "Enemy". a public int determines the damage of the bullet.
There is also a public int for Enemy health in the enemy script where the enemy health can be set there and
determines if health = 0, then the script will initiate Destroy(game0bject); (deleting enemy from the game). 

DEATH RESPAWN

initated through PlayerHealth Script. If the player collides with the enemy through 2D collision, player takes 1
damage (player has total 20 damage that can be altered in public in maxHealth). If the health goes to 0, the script
initates sequence "KillPlayer", that relocates player position to gameObject Spawn Point with max health. This also
happens if the player collides with the box collider set on "Killing Floor", which is a box collider set just below
the empty spaces should the player fall through the world.

HOW TO PLAY;

- Player falls into game, you can move player by pressing A & D or arrow keys left & right
- Press E to shoot enemies, if you collide with enemies your health will go down and you'll be respawned back in 
- Press space to jump over gaps and up stairs 
- Flag indicates there is no level left to play
